# Joint Recall and HAX

This is the official codebase of the paper [*Overcoming Long-Context Limitations of State-Space Models via Context-Dependent Sparse Attention*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00449).

## Overview

We introduce ***joint recall***, a novel synthetic task that extends associative recall to context-dependent key-value association, which offers a new perspective for both theoretical analysis and empirical benchmark for long-context modeling.

Guided by the theoretical analysis on ***joint recall***, we propose a novel architecture, **HAX**, based on state-space models (SSMs) integrated with context-dependent sparse attention (CDSA), which consistently outperforms SSMs and SSMs integrated with context-independent sparse attention (CISA) on both synthetic and real-world long-context benchmarks.

**HAX** stands for locality-sensitive **H**ashing **A**ttention with sparse **K**ey **S**election, combining LSH and key selection (KS) attention patterns. Both LSH and KS attention are context-dependent and serve as complementary mechanisms: LSH enables flexible, content-based interactions by routing queries to similar keys, while KS provides global focus by attending to a few important positions. We further integrate SSMs with HAX, as shown in the following figure, thereby addressing the theoretical expressiveness bottleneck of SSMs as analyzed on the ***joint recall*** task.

Finally, we would like to note that our ***joint recall*** task is not designed specifically for SSM optimization, but could serve as a **general-purpose tool for long-context modeling studies**.

## Installation

Please use the following versions of Python packages:

```
python==3.12.9
torch==2.6.0
transformers==4.49.0
datasets==3.4.0
triton==3.2.0
flash_attn==2.7.4.post1
mamba-ssm==2.2.4
causal-conv1d==1.5.0.post8
flash-linear-attention==0.2.0
```

## Reproduction

Our implementation is based on [Flash-Linear-Attention](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention)

To reproduce the synthetic experiments from the paper, please run:

```
python scripts/joint_recall.py \
    --base_arch [specify_base_arch] \
    --sparse_arch [specify_sparse_arch] \
    --data_dir [path_to_dataset_cache] \
    --save_dir [path_to_save_model]
```

**Options for --base_arch:**
- Mamba
- Mamba2
- Samba

**Options for --sparse_arch:**
- None (base SSM architectures that do not include the sparse attention module)
- dilated (+D)
- sliding_window (+SW)
- sliding_window+dilated (+SW+D)
- sliding_window+sink (+A)
- sign_bin_lsh (+LSH)
- key_selection (+KS)
- sign_bin_lsh+key_selection (+HAX)

For example, to run experiments with the base Mamba SSM, use:

```
python scripts/joint_recall.py --base_arch mamba
```

To run experiments with Mamba2 integrated with HAX, use:

```
python scripts/joint_recall.py --base_arch mamba2 --sparse_arch sign_bin_lsh+key_selection
```

To reproduce the synthetic data generation described in the paper, please run:

```
python scripts/create_dataset.py --data_dir [path_to_dataset_cache]
```

By default, this script generates the joint recall dataset used in the paper, including 1.4M training samples, 14.4K validation samples, and 14.4K test samples.
